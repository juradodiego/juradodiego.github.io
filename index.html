				<span class="image main"><img src="images/diego-and-bea.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Hello! I'm Diego Jurado, a full-stack software engineer at BNY, based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
					Over the past few years, I’ve grown as a technologist, scholar, and lifelong learner, exploring how
					my professional work, personal passions, and faith intersect.</p>

				<p>In my career, I focus on building systems that are secure, scalable, and reliable. I’ve gained
					experience in enterprise software engineering, full-stack development, and mentoring peers, and I
					continue to seek ways to make technology ethical, sustainable, and meaningful.</p>

				<p>Beyond work, I prioritize personal growth through athletics, arts, and community engagement. I train
					regularly in running and weightlifting, finding discipline and joy in movement. Music is central to
					my life — I enjoy attending the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and exploring the arts in general. I
					am actively engaged in my Episcopal community, volunteer in meaningful ways, and participate in the
					Jack Heinz Next Gen program at the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. I also continue theological
					studies through the Church Divinity School of the Pacific’s online program, integrating faith,
					reflection, and service into daily life.</p>

				<p>Recently, I got engaged to my long-time girlfriend Bea, and we are thrilled to be planning our
					wedding. This exciting time has been full of joy, reflection, and shared anticipation for the life
					we will build together.</p>

				<p>I enjoy reading widely, with favorites ranging from Murakami’s <i>Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His
						Years of Pilgrimage</i> to Weir's <i>The Martian</i>, Herbert's <i>Dune</i>, and Camus' <i>The
						Stranger</i>, which fuel curiosity and perspective in both my work and personal life.</p>

				<p>At my core, I am guided by my values of growth, family, and making the world a better place for all.
					I strive to live intentionally, contributing positively to my community while growing in knowledge,
					faith, and experience.</p>

					<h3>Web Applications</h3>

					<h4><a href="https://github.com/juradodiego">Personal Budgeting Web Application</a><br><i>April
							2023</i>
					</h4>
					<h5>Key Skills: REST APIs, React, Flask, Python</h5>
					<p>A very simple budget application for a single user. The application supports several budget
						categories, and a set monthly limit for each category (e.g., $825 for rent, $400 for groceries,
						$130
						for gas, etc.). The application allows the user to enter new categories and purchases and
						present up
						to date lists of the user's current categories and past purchases. Any purchases that were over
						budget for that month will be highlighted red in the list. The purpose of the project was to
						gain
						expeirence building RESTful APIs, and using two web-based frameworks cohesively. I gained
						experience
						using React, Flask, Python, ORMs, and REST APIs.</p>
					<p>Due to the academic integrity policies of CS 1520 (Programming Languages for Web Apps) and the
						University of Pittsburgh I am unable to share this code publicly. However, upon request, I will
						be
						more than happy to demo the project, explain how it works and how I implemented it.</p>

					<h4><a href="https://github.com/juradodiego">BeSocial: A Social Networking System</a><br><i>March
							2023 -
							April 2023</i></h4>
					<h5>Key Skills: Java, JDBC, PostgreSQL, Project Management</h5>
					<p>The primary goal of this project is to implement a single Java application program that will
						operate
						BeSocial, a Social Networking System. The core of such a system is a database system. The
						secondary
						goal is to learn how to work as a member of a team which designs and develops a relatively
						large,
						real database application. I am implementing an application program using Java, PostgreSQL, and
						JDBC. The focus is on the actual service and not the UI elements. One of the more fun aspects of
						the
						project was using Python to write a script that would generate SQL `Insert` statements to be
						used as
						sample data.</p>
					<p>Due to the academic integrity policies of CS 1555 (Database Management Systems) and the
						University of
						Pittsburgh I am unable to share this code publicly. However, upon request, I will be more than
						happy
						to demo the project, explain how it works and how I implemented it.</p>

							April 2023</i></h4>
					<h5>Key Skills: Python, Flask, JavaScript, AJAX, JSON</h5>
					<p>A web application that hosts and manages chat rooms. The purpose of this project was to gain
						experience using AJAX and JSON by building a website to host and manage multiple chat rooms. I
						also
						gained experience with HTML, JavaScript, Python, and Flask while implementing this project.</p>
					<p>Due to the academic integrity policies of CS 1520 (Programming Languages for Web Apps) and the
						University of Pittsburgh I am unable to share this code publicly. However, upon request, I will

					<h5>Key Skills: Python, Flask, JavaScript, HTML</h5>
					<p>A web application for a catering company. This website functions as an event scheduler, where
						customers can request events, and staff can sign up to work events. The goal of this project was
						to
						gain experience using Flask and building data models via an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) by
						developing a website to help manage a catering company. I gained experience using HTML, CSS,
						Python,
						Flask, and SQLAlchemy.</p>
					<p>Due to the academic integrity policies of CS 1520 (Programming Languages for Web Apps) and the
						University of Pittsburgh I am unable to share this code publicly. However, upon request, I will

					<h4><a href="https://github.com/juradodiego/cookbook-web-app">Food Dude Cookbook</a><br><i>August
							2022 -
							Decemeber 2022</i></h4>
					<h5>Key Skills: Java, Spring Boot, Unit Testing, Project Management</h5>
					<p>The Cookbook Web App, crafted with React and Spring Boot, was born out of frustration with
						lengthy
						preambles in recipe sources. Its aim? To provide users with quick, straight-to-the-point cooking
						instructions. React ensures a responsive interface, while Spring Boot handles backend
						functionalities like data processing and user authentication. With this streamlined approach,
						users
						can swiftly access concise recipes without unnecessary narratives, simplifying their culinary
						experience.</p>
					<p>As part of the project, I advocated for and strategically selected cutting-edge technologies in
						line
						with prevailing industry trends, including React for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend,
						and
						MySQL for the database. Utilizing Java within the Spring Boot framework, I spearheaded the
						development of a robust backend service and API controller, implementing a variety of software
						design patterns to ensure scalability and maintainability. Rigorous testing was integral to our
						process, and I orchestrated comprehensive testing protocols, achieving a remarkable 100% code
						coverage using JUnit, thus adhering to stringent quality standards. Over a span of four months,
						I
						assumed leadership of a team comprising four members, guiding and coordinating efforts to
						successfully implement and thoroughly test the full-stack application.</p>

					<h4><a href="https://github.com/juradodiego/panther-central-ios-app">Panther Central iOS
							Application</a><br><i>August 2022 - Decemeber 2022</i></h4>
					<h5>Key Skills: Dart, Flutter, UX Design, Mobile Development</h5>
					<p>The application was designed as a part of the Interface Design Course I took and it's purpose was
						brought upon by a frustration that when doing laundry at the University of Pittsburgh I had to
						pull
						out my phone, go to a website that could only be accessed through 4 clicks, and then fill in all
						my
						credit card information just to have money on my card to do laundry. It wa frustrating, so I
						took
						inspriation from a variety of sources that have facilitated loading currency onto company
						currency
						like Starbucks, Dave and Busters, and Dunkin.</p>
					<p>The application was constructed utilizing the Flutter programming framework. Our primary
						objective
						was to conceptualize an app idea, sketch its design using Balsamiq Wireframes, and then bring it
						to
						life through implementation with Flutter. The project unfolded across five distinct phases, each
						intricately connected to the design life cycle, ensuring a comprehensive approach to
						development.

										stars</a>
								</p>
								<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">
									A wonderfully humorous story—the first Hercule Poirot novel I have read.
								</p>
								<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">
									A charming investigation into the lives of several train passengers and conductors.
									The
									setting is thoroughly immersive: a murder inside a train stuck in a snowdrift,
									unable to
									contact the outside world. It is almost a miracle that an agent of truth was there
									to
									bear
									witness to such an extravagant and passionate scene.
								</p>
								<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">
									The novel is particularly cozy. Reading it at the start of the New Year, still
									riding
									the
									warmth of the Christmas season, I found it to be a perfect wintertime book. While
									the
									author
									uses some dated and stereotyped phrases, I believe these only add to the atmosphere;
									a
									feeling I can best describe as the familiarity of a relative saying something
									slightly
									“incorrect.” Nevertheless, it is a must-read, with a twist that will leave you both
									satisfied and perplexed.
