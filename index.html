								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main" style="width:50%"><img src="images/diego-thumbs-up.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Hello! I'm Diego Jurado, a passionate full-stack software engineer soon to graduate from the esteemed University of Pittsburgh with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Currently based in the vibrant city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and I anticipate continuing to contribute to this community for the foreseeable future.</p>
								<p>My journey in technology is underlined by a profound commitment to crafting a future that is not just technologically advanced, but also sustainable, secure, and private. This dedication stems from my invaluable experience working alongside Dr. Malihe Alikhani in the University of Pittsburgh AI Ethics research lab, where I delved into the ethical dimensions of data security, privacy, reliability, and bias. Additionally, my research shed light on the environmental implications of computing technologies, particularly the ecological footprint associated with training large AI models like LLMs.</p>
								<p>Beyond the realm of technology, I find solace in the world of literature, particularly within the works of authors such as Osamu Dazai, Kazuo Ishiguro, Kurt Vonnegut, and Ray Bradbury. Currently, my favorite novel, "No Longer Human" by Dazai, resonates deeply with me. In my spare time, I also channel my creativity into making video games. Notably, during my senior year at university, I collaborated with a talented team to develop "Immorticulture," a game centered around environmental stewardship and community engagement, which garnered the prestigious "Judge’s Choice" Award at the Games 4 Social Impact Game Jam.</p>
								<p>At my core, I am guided by the principles of being Pro-Environment, Pro-Education, and Pro-Family. As I embark on my professional journey, I am eager to specialize within software engineering, with a keen interest in software architecture or quality assurance. My aim is to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute meaningfully to projects that align with my values and make a positive impact on society.</p>
								<p>I look forward to the exciting opportunities and challenges that lie ahead as I continue to grow and evolve in my career.</p>

								<h3>Web Applications</h3>
								
								<h4><a href="https://github.com/juradodiego">Personal Budgeting Web Application</a><br><i>April 2023</i></h4>
								<h5>Key Skills: REST APIs, React, Flask, Python</h5>
								<p>A very simple budget application for a single user. The application supports several budget categories, and a set monthly limit for each category (e.g., $825 for rent, $400 for groceries, $130 for gas, etc.). The application allows the user to enter new categories and purchases and present up to date lists of the user's current categories and past purchases. Any purchases that were over budget for that month will be highlighted red in the list. The purpose of the project was to gain expeirence building RESTful APIs, and using two web-based frameworks cohesively. I gained experience using React, Flask, Python, ORMs, and REST APIs.</p>
								<p>Due to the academic integrity policies of CS 1520 (Programming Languages for Web Apps) and the University of Pittsburgh I am unable to share this code publicly. However, upon request, I will be more than happy to demo the project, explain how it works and how I implemented it.</p>
